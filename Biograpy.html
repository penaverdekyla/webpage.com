         <h1 align=center>WELCOME TO BIOGRAPHY OF FRED BROOKS</h1>
         <hr>
         <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><b>Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr</b>. was born on April 19, 1931 at Durham, N.Y.,United States.He is a software engineer and computer scientist best-known for managing the development of IBM's System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software support package. A winner of 1999 A.M Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science, for his “landmark contributions to computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering.” then later writing candidly about the process in his seminal book The Mythical Man-Month.</p>

    <p>Fred Brooks, a computer engineer, worked at IBM in the early days of supercomputers. He was a member of the teams that created IBM's ground-breaking Stretch and Harvest computers.  He and Dura Sweeney invented the stretch interrupt system, which intoduuced the majority of the features found in today's interrupt system.He was responsible for overseeing the development of the IBM System/360, the foundation of the first generation of commercial computers, and directed the software team that created the OS/360 operating system. He also originated the term "computer architecture".His work is seen as defining the still-dominant concept that distinguishes between computer hardware and software, and allows the separate but dynamically interlocking development of these two fields. 
</p>

    <p>He is well known for what is now called Brooks' Law, which summarizes problems inherent in increasing the staff of a troubled project: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." He has said that a central element of his team's success with the IBM 360 is that as the project progressed, his team effectively "shut out" interference from the company's hierarchy.

<p>

<p>Since leaving IBM in 1964, Brooks has taught computer science at the the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His work over recent decades involves virtual environments, comprised of real-time, three-dimensional, computer graphics which have helped biochemists understand the structure of complex molecules and allowed architects to create "walk-through" motion pictures showing the interiors of buildings based on architectural plans. Despite his association with IBM, Brooks said in a 2010 interview with Computer World magazine that his favorite computer is a Macintosh laptop.<p>
